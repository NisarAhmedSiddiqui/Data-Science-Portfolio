Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal was to create a system that accurately identifies fraud while minimizing false positives, which is crucial in real-world financial applications.

Data
The dataset consisted of anonymized credit card transactions, with features such as transaction amount, time, and more. I employed techniques like SMOTE to address the class imbalance and cleaned the data to ensure accuracy.

Models and Techniques
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
Cross-validation for model evaluation
Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of 99% and a precision of 98%, effectively reducing the number of false positives while maintaining high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Titanic Survival Prediction
Overview
This project used the famous Titanic dataset to predict the survival of passengers based on features like age, gender, class, and more. The focus was on applying various classification algorithms and feature engineering techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

Data
The dataset included information on Titanic passengers, such as age, gender, fare, and whether they survived. I performed extensive feature engineering, including handling missing values and creating new features like family size.

Models and Techniques
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Feature engineering and selection
Results
The model was able to achieve a high level of accuracy, with a final score of 82%, by effectively utilizing both numerical and categorical features in predicting passenger survival.

Iris Flower Classification
Overview
This project involved building a model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. It was a straightforward classification problem that helped reinforce my understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts.

Data
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. No significant preprocessing was required, making it a clean and ideal dataset for classification tasks.

Models and Techniques
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Cross-validation for model tuning
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 96%, demonstrating the effectiveness of simple yet powerful classification algorithms on well-structured datasets.

Sales Prediction Using Python
Overview
This project aimed to forecast future sales based on historical data. The objective was to build a predictive model that can assist businesses in making informed decisions about inventory and marketing strategies.

Data
The dataset included past sales data with features such as date, store, product, and sales volume. I performed time series analysis and used data preprocessing techniques like normalization and feature extraction.

Models and Techniques
Linear Regression
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
Time Series Analysis
Feature engineering and selection
Results
The model successfully predicted future sales trends with a high degree of accuracy, providing valuable insights that can help in decision-making processes for inventory management and marketing.
